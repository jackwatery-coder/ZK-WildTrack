# 🦌 ZK-WildTrack: Zero-Knowledge Wildlife Migration Tracking

Welcome to ZK-WildTrack, a decentralized Web3 solution for tracking wildlife migrations! This project uses zero-knowledge proofs on the Stacks blockchain to share valuable migration patterns with researchers while protecting sensitive location data from poachers, habitat exploiters, or unauthorized access. By leveraging blockchain's immutability and Clarity smart contracts, we enable secure, privacy-preserving data sharing to support conservation efforts and scientific research.

## 🌍 Real-World Problem Solved

Wildlife migration tracking generates critical data for conservation, but sharing raw GPS coordinates risks exposing animals to threats like poaching. Traditional centralized databases are vulnerable to breaches, and data silos hinder collaborative research. ZK-WildTrack solves this by allowing trackers (e.g., conservationists with IoT sensors) to submit proofs of migration patterns—such as routes, timings, and herd sizes—without revealing exact locations. Researchers can access aggregated insights trustlessly, fostering global collaboration while maintaining data privacy.

## ✨ Features

🔒 Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving data submission  
📊 Share aggregated migration patterns (e.g., seasonal trends, population densities) for research  
🦺 Immutable on-chain storage of verified proofs  
👥 Role-based access for trackers, researchers, and validators  
💰 Incentive tokens for data contributors  
🔍 Queryable dashboard for verified patterns without exposing raw data  
🚨 Dispute mechanism for challenging invalid proofs  
🌐 Integration with off-chain oracles for real-time environmental data  

## 🛠 Smart Contracts Overview

This project is built using Clarity on the Stacks blockchain and involves 8 smart contracts for a robust, modular architecture:

1. **UserRegistry.clar**: Handles registration of users (trackers, researchers, validators) with roles and permissions.  
2. **DataHasher.clar**: Computes and stores hashes of raw migration data (e.g., GPS points) for later proof verification.  
3. **ZKVerifier.clar**: Verifies zero-knowledge proofs submitted by trackers, ensuring patterns are derived from real data without revealing locations.  
4. **PatternAggregator.clar**: Aggregates verified patterns into shareable datasets (e.g., average migration speeds or routes as vectors).  
5. **AccessControl.clar**: Manages permissions for querying or submitting data, using NFTs or tokens for gated access.  
6. **IncentiveToken.clar**: Mints and distributes STX-based tokens to reward data contributors and validators.  
7. **QueryEngine.clar**: Allows researchers to query aggregated patterns with filters (e.g., by species or region) while enforcing privacy rules.  
8. **DisputeResolver.clar**: Enables challenges to submitted proofs, with slashing mechanisms for bad actors.

## 🚀 How It Works

**For Trackers (Data Contributors)**  
- Collect migration data via GPS sensors or IoT devices.  
- Generate a zero-knowledge proof off-chain (using tools like zk-SNARKs) that attests to patterns (e.g., "This herd migrated 500km south in Q3 without crossing protected zones").  
- Call `submit-proof` on ZKVerifier.clar with the proof, hashed data, and metadata (e.g., species, timestamp).  
- The contract verifies the proof and stores it immutably.  
- Earn incentive tokens via IncentiveToken.clar for valid submissions.  

**For Researchers**  
- Register via UserRegistry.clar to gain query access.  
- Use QueryEngine.clar to fetch aggregated patterns (e.g., `get-migration-trends` for a species).  
- Data is returned as anonymized insights—no raw locations exposed.  
- Optionally, stake tokens to access premium datasets.  

**For Validators**  
- Monitor submissions and call `challenge-proof` on DisputeResolver.clar if suspicious.  
- If a proof fails verification in a dispute, the submitter's stake is slashed.  

**Technical Flow**  
1. Tracker hashes raw data and submits to DataHasher.clar.  
2. Off-chain: Generate ZK proof.  
3. On-chain: ZKVerifier.clar checks proof validity.  
4. PatternAggregator.clar compiles approved proofs into datasets.  
5. AccessControl.clar ensures only authorized users query via QueryEngine.clar.  
6. Incentives and disputes handled by IncentiveToken.clar and DisputeResolver.clar.  

Boom! Secure, collaborative wildlife research without compromising animal safety.

## 📚 Getting Started

1. Set up a Stacks wallet and Clarity development environment.  
2. Deploy the contracts in order: UserRegistry → DataHasher → ZKVerifier → PatternAggregator → AccessControl → IncentiveToken → QueryEngine → DisputeResolver.  
3. Integrate off-chain ZK libraries (e.g., via JavaScript for proof generation).  
4. Test with sample data: Simulate migrations and verify privacy preservation.
